# GitHub Users and Repositories Data

- I utilized the GitHub API to scrape data on users located in Toronto with over 100 followers, gathering both their profile information and public repositories.
- One surprising finding was that some users had a substantial number of repositories while having fewer than 1,000 followers, highlighting that follower count does not always correlate with repository activity.
- To enhance community engagement, I recommend developers in Toronto connect with users who have numerous repositories, as they may offer valuable insights and collaboration opportunities.

# Data Files
`users.csv`: Contains information about GitHub users, including their profiles and work history.

`repositories.csv`: Lists the public repositories of the users, detailing their activity and contributions.
